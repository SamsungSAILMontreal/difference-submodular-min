# Difference of Submodular Minimization via DC Programming


Code to reproduce results of the paper Difference of Submodular Minimization via DC Programming

## To reproduce results in the paper
- run dsm_job.sh script 
- plot results using dsm_plot.m

## Datasets
- Datasets are already included in datasets folder
- The speech dataset was included with the code from [1].
- The mushroom dataset was downloaded from https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&status=active&id=24. The train/test splits  used in our experiments were generated by running the python script mushroom.py (requires NumPy, SciPy, and pandas).

```bash
cd datasets 
python mushroom.py
```

- We use some functions from [1] (mainly the implementation of MNP algorithm).
- We use for plotting a modified version of the padcat function from [2].
- We use for plotting the distinguishable_colors function from [3].
